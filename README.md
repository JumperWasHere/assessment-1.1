Angular combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges. Angular empowers developers to build applications that live on the web, mobile, or the desktop.

## Do and Don't
   - Do clone this repository
   - Don't use any existing angular component, example [ng-select](https://ng-select.github.io/ng-select)
   - Do create your own tagging input implementation and place it under shared folder.

## Your task

Create a custom **tagging input** component that will work for both **reactive form** and **model**. The **tagging input** styling need to be the same as **bootstrap form input** in term of color, width and height. You can use any custom select plugin such as [Selectize](https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js) or [Select2](https://github.com/select2/select2).
